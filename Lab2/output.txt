--------- Decoding ----------
there was a wall ahead it began high in the air and extended
upward out of sight it was riddled with holes that were the mouths of
tunnels gaal's taxi moved toward one, then plunged into it for a moment gaal
wondered idly how his driver could pick out one among so many there was now
only blackness with nothing but the past-flashing of a colored signal light to
relieve the gloom the air was full of a rushing sound gaal leaned forward
against deceleration then and the taxi popped out of the tunnel and
descended to ground-level once more the luxor hotel said the driver
unnecessarily he helped gaal with his baggage accepted a tenth-credit tip
with a businesslike air picked up a waiting passenger and was rising again
in all this from the moment of debarkation there had been no glimpse of sky
trantor at the beginning of the thirteenth millennium this tendency
reached its climax as the center of the imperial government for unbroken
hundreds of generations and located as it was toward the central regions
of the galaxy among the most densely populated and industrially advanced
worlds of the system, it could scarcely help being the densest and richest
clot of humanity the race had ever seen its urbanization, progressing
steadily had finally reached the ultimate. all the land surface of trantor
square miles in extent was a single city the population at its height was
well in excess of forty billions this enormous population was devoted almost
entirely to the administrative necessities of empire and found
themselves all too few for the complications of the task (it is to be
remembered that the impossibility of proper administration of the
galactic empire under the uninspired leadership of the later emperors
was a considerable factor in the fall) daily fleets of ships in the tens of
thousands brought the produce of twenty agricultural worlds to the
dinner tables of trantor its dependence upon the outer worlds for food and
indeed for all necessities of life made trantor increasingly vulnerable to
conquest by siege in the last millennium of the empire the monotonously
numerous revolts made emperor after emperor conscious of this and
imperial policy became little more than the protection of trantor's
delicate jugular vein
